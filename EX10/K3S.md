## When should it be used?
- When you want to run containers in a lightweight and fast environment.  
- In projects with limited computing resources .  
- For development, testing, or Edge Computing purposes .



## Where can it be used?
- Personal computers for development and learning.  
- Edge Computing & IoT: Running Kubernetes on small devices in remote locations.
- In the cloud or Edge environments.

## Why should I use it?
- Easy to install and manage, less complex than full Kubernetes.  
- Requires fewer resources (low RAM and CPU).
